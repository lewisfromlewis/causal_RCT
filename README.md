# causal_RCT
Marrying two niche branches of ontology, I propose a practical, useful and universal revolution.

Clinical trials are often conceptually divided into those which are explanatory and those which are pragmatic, or in simple terms those answering the questions "how does it work?" and "which works better?", respectively. We believe that a pragmatic trial generates large amounts of high quality mechanistic information which is not commonly used, either in the course of the trial to inform safe delivery of the intervention, or in the design of future trials. We propose for the first time a method to combine two powerful inferential concepts via network theory: responsive adaptive randomisation within a clinical trial, and causal network production. We believe that this may allow pragmatic trials to clarify the mechanisms at work either to explain the observed results within the explanatory paradigm, or to modify treatments during the course of the trial while still allowing reliable inference.
